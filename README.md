# American-Sign-Language-Recognition-System
 This is my final year project on American Sign Language uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize and translate ASL gestures into written text and Speech. The CNN model is trained on a large dataset of ASL images, and the project includes a user interface, image processing module, and database of signs and translations. The project aims to make ASL more accessible and improve communication between the deaf and hearing communities.
